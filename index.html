      <div class="about-body">
      <p>My name is Andy Bilodeau. I live in Charlotte, NC. I am currently attending a coding bootcamp to take my career path to the next level. I will be learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript primarly. I have been in many fields of work; retail, sales, construction, HR/team development, and health care. I have enjoyed each job I have and I have learned a great deal from all of them. I wanted to switch to tech because I am getting older and would like to start my "forever" job, and with tech on the rise and something that will always be wanted, I thought this would be best.
      <br>
      <br>
      As for who I am, I have many things that make up who I am. I am a dog owner, I have a Shiba Inu named Suki. She is my world and I try to bring here everywhere I go. I love hiking with family, it is something that keeps me close with my parents and builds a connection between me and my neice. I love watching football, I am a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan. I have been a fan my whole life, not recently. I like playing video games, I currently play Valorant and Rocet League. When I am not busy with those, I have friends that I enjoy meeting up with at local breweries.
